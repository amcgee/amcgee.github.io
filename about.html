			<p>I am currently the executive director at <a href="http://www.welldone.org">WellDone International</a> where I do business stuff and sometimes build things (BS EECS, UC Berkeley) while other people sleep.</p>

			<p>When I do have time to sleep, instead I go rock climbing or running.  I also play classical trumpet sometimes (BA Music, UC Berkeley).</p>

			<p>Go bears.</p>
